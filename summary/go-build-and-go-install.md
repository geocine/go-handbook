# “go build” and “go install”

Let's tidy up the `$GOPATH` directory and only keep `Go` source code files left over:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        └── hello.go

5 directories, 2 files
```

The `greet.go` is `greet` package which just provides one function:

```text
# cat src/greet/greet.go
package greet

import "fmt"

func Greet() {
        fmt.Println("Hello 中国!")
}
```

While `hello.go` is a `main` package which takes advantage of `greet` and can be built into an executable binary:

```text
# cat src/hello/hello.go
package main

import "greet"

func main() {
        greet.Greet()
}
```

\(1\) Enter the `src/hello` directory, and execute `go build` command:

```text
# pwd
/root/gowork/src/hello
# go build
# ls
hello  hello.go
# ./hello
Hello 中国!
```

We can see a fresh `hello` command is created in the current directory.

Check the `$GOPATH` directory:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        ├── hello
        └── hello.go

5 directories, 3 files
```

Compared before executing `go build`, there is only a final executable command more.

\(2\) Clear the `$GOPATH` directory again:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        └── hello.go

5 directories, 2 files
```

Running `go install` in `hello` directory:

```text
# pwd
/root/gowork/src/hello
# go install
#
```

Check the `$GOPATH` directory now:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
│   └── hello
├── pkg
│   └── linux_amd64
│       └── greet.a
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        └── hello.go

6 directories, 4 files
```

Not only the `hello` command is generated and put into `bin` directory, but also the `greet.a` is in the `pkg/linux_amd64`. While the `src` folder keeps clean with only source code files in it and unchanged.

\(3\) There is `-i` flag in `go build` command which will install the packages that are dependencies of the target, but won't install the target. Let's check it:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        └── hello.go

5 directories, 2 files
```

Run `go build -i` under `hello` directory:

```text
# pwd
#/root/gowork/src/hello
# go build -i
```

Check `$GOPATH` now:

```text
# tree
.
├── bin
├── pkg
│   └── linux_amd64
│       └── greet.a
└── src
    ├── greet
    │   └── greet.go
    └── hello
        ├── hello
        └── hello.go
```

Except a `hello` command in `src/hello` directory, a `greet.a` library is also generated in `pkg/linux_amd64` too.

\(4\) By default, the `go build` uses the directory's name as the compiled binary's name, to modify it, you can use `-o` flag:

```text
# pwd
/root/gowork/src/hello
# go build -o he
# ls
he  hello.go
```

Now, the command is `he`, not `hello`.
