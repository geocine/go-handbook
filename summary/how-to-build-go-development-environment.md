# Setting up the Go development environment

Setting up the  `Go` development environment is always easy.  Just download the binary package which matches your system from [here](https://golang.org/dl/), and uncompress it:

```text
# wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.10.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# tar -C /usr/local/ -xzf go1.10.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> Note: You can do the same thing on `Mac` just use the `darwin*` package

Now, there is an extra `go` directory under `/usr/local`. It's done! Too easy, right? Yes, but there are still some windup work to do:

\(1\) To run `Go` utilities \(`go`, `gofmt`, etc\) conveniently, you should add `/usr/local/go` into `$PATH` environment variable:

```text
# cat /etc/profile  
......
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export PATH 
......
```

\(2\) It is **strongly recommended** to install `Go` in `/usr/local/go` under `*nix` and `c:\Go` under `Windows` since these default directories have already been embedded in `Go` binary distributions. If you choose another directory, you **must** set `$GOROOT` environment variable:

```text
# cat /etc/profile  
......
GOROOT=/path/to/go
export GOROOT
```

So the `$GOROOT` is only need when you install `Go` on a custom directory, not default.
