# init function

There is a `init()` function, as the name suggests, it will do some initialization work, such as initializing variables which may not be expressed easily, or calibrating program state. A file can contain one or more `init()` functions, as shown here:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

var global int = 0

func init() {
    global++
    fmt.Println("In first Init(), global is: ", global)
}

func init() {
    global++
    fmt.Println("In Second Init(), global is: ", global)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("In main(), global is: ", global)
}
```

The execution result is like this:

```text
In first Init(), global is:  1
In Second Init(), global is:  2
In main(), global is:  2
```

Since one package can contain multiple files, there may be many `init()` functions. You **should not** presume which file's `init()` functions are executed first. The only thing which is guaranteed is that the variables declared in package will be evaluated before all `init()` functions are executed in this package.

See another example. The `$GOROOT/src` directory is like this:

```text
# tree
.
├── foo
│   └── foo.go
└── play
    └── main.go
```

There are `2` simple packages: `foo` and `play`. The `foo/foo.go` is here:

```text
package foo

import "fmt"

var Global int

func init() {
        Global++
        fmt.Println("foo init() is called, Global is: ", Global)
}
```

While the `play/main.go` is:

```text
package main

import "foo"


func main() {
}
```

Build `play` command:

```text
# go install play
# play
src/play/main.go:3: imported and not used: "foo"
```

The cause of this error is that `main.go` doesn't use any functions or variables exported by `foo` package. So if you just want an imported package's `init()` function is executed, and don't want to use package's other stuff, you should modify "`import "foo"`" to "`import _ "foo"`":

```text
 package main

import _ "foo"


func main() {
}
```

Now the build process will success, and the output of `play` command is like this:

```text
# play
foo init() is called, Global is:  1
```
