# Check data race

"Data race" is a common but notorious issue in concurrency programs. sometimes it is difficult to debug and reproduce, especially in some big system, so this will make people very frustrated. Thankfully, the `Go` toolchain provides a `race detector` \(now only works on `amd64` platform.\) which can help us quickly spot and fix this kind of issue, and this can save our time even lives!

Take the following classic "data race" program as an example:

```text
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "sync"
)

var global int
var wg sync.WaitGroup

func count() {
        defer wg.Done()
        for i := 0; i < 10000; i++{
                global++
        }
}

func main() {
        wg.Add(2)
        go count()
        go count()
        wg.Wait()
        fmt.Println(global)
}
```

Two tasks increase `global` variable simultaneously, so the final value of `global` is non-deterministic. Using `race detector` to check it:

```text
# go run -race race.go
==================
WARNING: DATA RACE
Read by goroutine 7:
  main.count()
      /root/gocode/src/race.go:14 +0x6d

Previous write by goroutine 6:
  main.count()
      /root/gocode/src/race.go:14 +0x89

Goroutine 7 (running) created at:
  main.main()
      /root/gocode/src/race.go:21 +0x6d

Goroutine 6 (running) created at:
  main.main()
      /root/gocode/src/race.go:20 +0x55
==================
19444
Found 1 data race(s)
exit status 66
```

Cool! the `race detector` finds the issue precisely, and it also provides the detailed tips of how to modifying it. Adding the lock of writing the `global` variable:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var global int
var wg sync.WaitGroup
var w sync.Mutex

func count() {
    defer wg.Done()
    for i := 0; i < 10000; i++{
        w.Lock()
        global++
        w.Unlock()
    }
}

func main() {
    wg.Add(2)
    go count()
    go count()
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println(global)
}  
```

This time, race detector is calm:

```text
# go run -race non_race.go
20000
```

Please be accustomed to use this powerful tool frequently, you will appreciate it, I promise!
