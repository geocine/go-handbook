# Prepend

`Go` has a built-in [append](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#append) function which add elements in the slice:

```text
func append(slice []Type, elems ...Type) []Type
```

But how if we want to the "prepend" effect? Maybe we should use `copy` function. E.g.:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    var s []int = []int{1, 2}
    fmt.Println(s)

    s1 := make([]int, len(s) + 1)
    s1[0] = 0
    copy(s1[1:], s)
    s = s1
    fmt.Println(s)

} 
```

The result is like this:

```text
[1 2]
[0 1 2]
```

But the above code looks ugly and cumbersome, so an elegant implementation maybe here:

```text
s = append([]int{0}, s...)
```

BTW, I also have tried to write a "general-purpose" prepend:

```text
func Prepend(v interface{}, slice []interface{}) []interface{}{
    return append([]interface{}{v}, slice...)
}
```

But since `[]T` can't convert to an `[]interface{}` directly \(please refer [https://golang.org/doc/faq\#convert\_slice\_of\_interface](https://golang.org/doc/faq#convert_slice_of_interface), it is just a toy, not useful.
