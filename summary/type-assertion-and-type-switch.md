# Type assertion and type switch

Sometimes, you may want to know the exact type of an interface variable. In this scenario, you can use `type assertion`:

```text
x.(T)
```

`x` is the variable whose type must be **interface**, and `T` is the type which you want to check. For example:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(v interface{}) {
    fmt.Printf("The value of v is: %v", v.(int))
}

func main() {
    v := 10
    printValue(v)
}
```

The running result is:

```text
The value of v is: 10
```

In the above example, using `v.(int)` to assert the `v` is `int` variable.

if the `type assertion` operation fails, a running panic will occur: change

```text
fmt.Printf("The value of v is: %v", v.(int))  
```

into:

```text
fmt.Printf("The value of v is: %v", v.(string))
```

Then executing the program will get following error:

```text
panic: interface conversion: interface is int, not string

goroutine 1 [running]:
panic(0x4f0840, 0xc0820042c0)
......
```

To avoid this, `type assertion` actually returns an additional `boolean` variable to tell whether this operations holds or not. So modify the program as follows:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(v interface{}) {
    if v, ok := v.(string); ok {
        fmt.Printf("The value of v is: %v", v)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Oops, it is not a string!")
    }

}

func main() {
    v := 10
    printValue(v)
}
```

This time, the output is:

```text
Oops, it is not a string!
```

Furthermore, you can also use `type switch` which makes use of `type assertion` to determine the type of variable, and do the operations accordingly. Check the following example:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(v interface{}) {
    switch v := v.(type) {
    case string:
        fmt.Printf("%v is a string\n", v)
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("%v is an int\n", v)
    default:
        fmt.Printf("The type of v is unknown\n")
    }
}

func main() {
    v := 10
    printValue(v)
}
```

The running result is here:

```text
10 is an int
```

Compared to `type assertion`, `type switch` uses keyword `type` instead of the specified variable type \(such as `int`\) in the parentheses.
