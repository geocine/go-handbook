# Types

Types in `Go` are divided into `2` categories: named and unnamed. Besides predeclared types \(such as `int`, `rune`, etc\), you can also define named type yourself. E.g.:

```text
type mySlice []int
```

Unnamed types are defined by type literal. I.e., `[]int` is an unnamed type.

According to [Go spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Types), there is an underlying type of every type:

> Each type T has an underlying type: If T is one of the predeclared boolean, numeric, or string types, or a type literal, the corresponding underlying type is T itself. Otherwise, T's underlying type is the underlying type of the type to which T refers in its type declaration.

So, in above example, both named type `mySlice` and unnamed type `[]int` have the same underlying type: `[]int`.

`Go` has strict rules of assigning values of variables. For example:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

type mySlice1 []int
type mySlice2 []int

func main() {
    var s1 mySlice1
    var s2 mySlice2 = s1

    fmt.Println(s1, s2)
}
```

The compilation will complain the following error:

```text
cannot use s1 (type mySlice1) as type mySlice2 in assignment
```

Although the underlying type of `s1` and `s2` are same: `[]int`, but they belong to `2` different named types \(`mySlice1` and `mySlice2`\), so they can't assign values each other. But if you modify `s2`'s type to `[]int`, the compilation will be OK:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

type mySlice1 []int

func main() {
    var s1 mySlice1
    var s2 []int = s1

    fmt.Println(s1, s2)
}
```

The magic behind it is one rule of [assignability](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Assignability):

> x's type V and T have identical underlying types and at least one of V or T is not a named type.
