# Accessing map

Map is a reference type which points to a hash table, and you can use it to construct a "key-value" database which is very handy in practice programming. E.g., the following code will calculate the count of every element in a slice:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    s := []int{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
    m := make(map[int]int)

    for _, v := range s {
        m[v]++
    }

    for key, value := range m {
        fmt.Printf("%d occurs %d times\n", key, value)
    }
} 
```

The output is like this:

```text
3 occurs 3 times
1 occurs 2 times
2 occurs 2 times
```

Moreover, according to [Go spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Map_types): "A map is an **unordered** group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type.". So if you run the above program another time, the output may be different:

```text
2 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 3 times
1 occurs 2 times
```

You must not presume the element order of a map.

The key type of the map must can be compared with "`==`" operator: the built-in types, such as int, string, etc, satisfy this requirement; while slice not. For struct type, if its members all can be compared by "`==`" operator, then this struct can also be used as key.

When you access a non-exist key of the map, the map will return the `nil` value of the element. I.e.:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    m := make(map[int]bool)

    m[0] = false
    m[1] = true

    fmt.Println(m[0], m[1], m[2])
}
```

The output is:

```text
false true false
```

the value of `m[0]` and `m[2]` are both `false`, so you can't discriminate whether the key is really in map or not. The solution is to use “comma ok” method:

```text
value, ok := map[key]
```

if the key does exit, `ok` will be `true`; else `ok` will be `false`.

Sometimes, you may not care the values of the map, and use map just as a set. In this case, you can declare the value type as an empty struct: `struct{}`. An example is like this:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func check(m map[int]struct{}, k int) {
    if _, ok := m[k]; ok {
        fmt.Printf("%d is a valid key\n", k)
    }
}
func main() {
    m := make(map[int]struct{})
    m[0] = struct{}{}
    m[1] = struct{}{}

    for  i := 0; i <=2; i++ {
        check(m, i)
    }
}  
```

The output is:

```text
0 is a valid key
1 is a valid key
```

Using built-in `delete` function, you can remove an entry in the map, even the key doesn't exist:

```text
delete(map, key)
```
