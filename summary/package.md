# Package

In `Go`, the packages can be divided into `2` categories:

\(1\) `main` package: is used to generate the executable binary, and the `main` function is the entry point of the program. Take `hello.go` as an example:

```text
package main

import "greet"

func main() {
    greet.Greet()
}
```

\(2\) This category can also include `2` types:

a\) Library package: is used to generate the object files that can be reused by others. Take `greet.go` as an example:

```text
package greet

import "fmt"

func Greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello 中国!")
}
```

b\) Some other packages for special purposes, such as testing.

Nearly every program needs `Go` standard \(`$GOROOT`\) or third-pary \(`$GOPATH`\) packages. To use them, you should use `import` statement:

```text
import "fmt"
import "github.com/NanXiao/stack" 
```

Or:

```text
import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/NanXiao/stack"
)
```

In the above examples, the "`fmt`" and "`github.com/NanXiao/stack`" are called `import path`, which is used to find the relevant package.

You may also see the following cases:

```text
import m "lib/math" // use m as the math package name
import . "lib/math" // Omit package name when using math package
```

If the `go install` command can't find the specified package, it will complain the error messages like this:

```text
... : cannot find package "xxxx" in any of:
        /usr/local/go/src/xxxx (from $GOROOT)
        /root/gowork/src/xxxx (from $GOPATH)
```

To avoid library conflicts, you'd better make your own packages' path the only one in the world: E.g., your `github` repository destination:

```text
 github.com/NanXiao/...
```

**Conventionally**, your package name should be same with the last item in `import path`; it is a good coding habit though not a must.
