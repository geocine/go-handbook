# Processing JSON object

[JSON](http://www.json.org/) is a commonly used and powerful data-interchange format, and `Go` provides a built-in [json](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) package to handle it. Let' see the following example:

```text
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

type People struct {
    Name string
    age int
    Career string `json:"career"`
    Married bool `json:",omitempty"`
}

func main()  {
    p := &People{
        Name: "Nan",
        age: 34,
        Career: "Engineer",
    }

    data, err := json.Marshal(p)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("JSON marshaling failed: %s", err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%s\n", data)
}
```

And the execution result is shown as follows:

```text
{"Name":"Nan","career":"Engineer"}
```

The [Marshal](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal) function is used to serialize an interface into a `JSON` object. In our example, it encodes a `People` struct:

\(1\) The `Name` member is encoded as our expectation:

```text
"Name":"Nan"
```

\(2\) Where is the `age` field? We can't find it in our result. The cause is only exported members of struct can be marshaled, so that means only the name whose first letter capitalized can be encoded into `JSON` object \(In our example, you should use `Age` instead of `age`\).

\(3\) The name of `Career` field is `career`, not `Career`:

```text
"career":"Engineer"
```

That's because the following tag: `json:"career"`, which tells the `Marshal` function to use `career` in the `JSON` object.

\(4\) We also can't see `Married` in the result although it has been exported, the magic behind is the `json:",omitempty"` tag which tells `Marshal` function no need to encode this member if it uses the default value.

There is another [Unmarshal](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal) function which is used to parse a `JSON` object. See the following example which extends from the above one:

```text
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

type People struct {
    Name string
    age int
    Career string `json:"career"`
    Married bool `json:",omitempty"`
}

func main()  {
    var p People
    data, err := json.Marshal(&People{Name: "Nan", age: 34, Career: "Engineer", Married: true})

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("JSON marshaling failed: %s", err)
    }

    err = json.Unmarshal(data, &p)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("JSON unmarshaling failed: %s", err)
    }

    fmt.Println(p)
}
```

The running result is like this:

```text
{Nan 0 Engineer true}
```

We can see the `JSON` object is decoded successfully.

Besides `Marshal` and `Unmarshal` functions, the `json` package also provides [Encoder](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Encoder) and [Decoder](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Decoder) structs which are used to process `JSON` object from stream. E.g., It is not uncommon to see code which handle `HTTP` likes this:

```text
func postFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ......

    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&request); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    ......
}
```

Because the mechanism of both methods are similar, it is not necessary to overtalk `Encoder` and `Decoder` here.
