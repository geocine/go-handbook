# Select operation

`Go`'s `select` operation looks similar to `switch`, but it's dedicated to poll send and receive operations channels. Check the following example:

```text
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
)

func main() {
        ch1 := make(chan int)
        ch2 := make(chan int)

        go func(ch chan int) { <-ch }(ch1)
        go func(ch chan int) { ch <- 2 }(ch2)

        time.Sleep(time.Second)

        for {
                select {
                case ch1 <- 1:
                        fmt.Println("Send operation on ch1 works!")
                case <-ch2:
                        fmt.Println("Receive operation on ch2 works!")
                default:
                        fmt.Println("Exit now!")
                        return
                }
        }
}
```

The running result is like this:

```text
Send operation on ch1 works!
Receive operation on ch2 works!
Exit now!
```

The `select` operation will check which `case` branch can be run, that means the send or receive action can be executed successfully. If more than one `case` are ready now, the `select` will randomly choose one to execute. If no `case` is ready, but there is a `default` branch, then the `default` block will be executed, else the `select` operation will block. In the above example, if the `main` goroutine doesn't sleep \(`time.Sleep(time.Second)`\), the other `2 func` goroutines won't obtain the opportunity to run, so only `default` block in `select` statement will be executed.

The `select` statement won't process `nil` channel, so if a channel used for receive operation is closed, you should mark its value as `nil`, then it will be kicked out of the selection list. So a common pattern of selection on multiple receive channels looks like this:

```text
for ch1 != nil && ch2 != nil {
    select {
    case x, ok := <-ch1:
        if !ok {
            ch1 = nil
            break
        }
        ......
    case x, ok := <-ch2:
        if !ok {
            ch2 = nil
            break
        }
        ......
    }
}  
```
