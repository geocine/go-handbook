# Functional literals

A functional literal just represents an anonymous function. You can assign functional literal to a variable:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    f := func() { fmt.Println("Hello, 中国！") }
    f()
}
```

Or invoke functional literal directly \(Please notice the `()` at the end of functional literal\):

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    func() { fmt.Println("Hello, 中国！") }()
}
```

The above `2` programs both output "`Hello, 中国！`".

Functional literal is also a closure, so it can access the variables of its surrounding function. Check the following example which your real intention is `1` and `2` are printed:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 2; i++ {
        go func() {fmt.Println(i)}()
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

But the output is:

```text
3
3
```

The cause is the `func` goroutines don't get the opportunity to run until the `main` goroutine sleeps, and at that time, the variable `i` has been changed to `3`. Modify the above program as follows:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 2; i++ {
        go func() {fmt.Println(i)}()
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
    }
} 
```

The `func` goroutine can run before `i` is changed, so the running result is what you expect:

```text
1
2
```

But the idiom method should be passing `i` as an argument of the functional literal:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 2; i++ {
        go func(i int) {fmt.Println(i)}(i)
    }
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

In above program, When "`go func(i int) {fmt.Println(i)}(i)`" is executed \(Note: not goroutine is executed.\), `i` defined in `main()` is assigned to `func`'s local parameter `i`. And the result is:

```text
1
2
```

P.S. You should notice, If you pass an argument while not use it, the `Go` compiler doesn't complain, but the closure will use the variable inherited from the parent function. That means the following statement:

```text
go func(int) {fmt.Println(i)}(i) 
```

equals to:

```text
go func() {fmt.Println(i)}()
```
