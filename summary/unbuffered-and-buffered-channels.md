# Unbuffered and buffered channels

The channel is divided into two categories: unbuffered and buffered.

\(1\) Unbuffered channel  
For unbuffered channel, the sender will block on the channel until the receiver receives the data from the channel, whilst the receiver will also block on the channel until sender sends data into the channel. Check the following example:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go func(ch chan int) {
        fmt.Println("Func goroutine begins sending data")
        ch <- 1
        fmt.Println("Func goroutine ends sending data")
     }(ch)

    fmt.Println("Main goroutine sleeps 2 seconds")
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)

    fmt.Println("Main goroutine begins receiving data")
    d := <- ch
    fmt.Println("Main goroutine received data:", d)

    time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

The running result likes this:

```text
Main goroutine sleeps 2 seconds
Func goroutine begins sending data
Main goroutine begins receiving data
Main goroutine received data: 1
Func goroutine ends sending data
```

After the `main` goroutine is launched, it will sleep immediately\("`Main goroutine sleeps 2 seconds`" is printed\), and this will cause `main` goroutine relinquishes the `CPU` to the `func` goroutine\("`Func goroutine begins sending data`" is printed\). But since the `main` goroutine is sleeping and can't receive data from the channel, so `ch <- 1` operation in `func` goroutine can't complete until `d := <- ch` in `main` goroutine is executed\(The final `3` logs are printed\).

\(2\) Buffered channel  
Compared with unbuffered counterpart, the sender of buffered channel will block when there is **no** empty slot of the `channel`, while the receiver will block on the channel when it is empty. Modify the above example:

```text
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 2)

    go func(ch chan int) {
        for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
            ch <- i
            fmt.Println("Func goroutine sends data: ", i)
        }
        close(ch)
    }(ch)

    fmt.Println("Main goroutine sleeps 2 seconds")
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)

    fmt.Println("Main goroutine begins receiving data")
    for d := range ch {
        fmt.Println("Main goroutine received data:", d)
    }
}
```

The executing result is as follows:

```text
Main goroutine sleeps 2 seconds
Func goroutine sends data:  1
Func goroutine sends data:  2
Main goroutine begins receiving data
Main goroutine received data: 1
Main goroutine received data: 2
Main goroutine received data: 3
Func goroutine sends data:  3
Func goroutine sends data:  4
Func goroutine sends data:  5
Main goroutine received data: 4
Main goroutine received data: 5
```

In this sample, since the channel has `2` slots, so the `func` goroutine will not block until it sends the third element.

P.S., "`make(chan int, 0)`" is equal to "`make(chan int)`", and it will create an unbuffered `int` channel too.
