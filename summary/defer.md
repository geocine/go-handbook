# defer

The `defer` statement is used to postpone a function call executed immediately before the surrounding function returns. The common uses of `defer` include releasing resources \(i.e., unlock the mutex, close file handle.\), do some tracing\(i.e., record the running time of function\), etc. E.g., an ordinary accessing global variable exclusively is like this:

```text
var mu sync.Mutex
var m = make(map[string]int)

func lookup(key string) int {
    mu.Lock()
    v := m[key]
    mu.Unlock()
    return v
}
```

An equivalent but concise format using `defer` is as follow:

```text
var mu sync.Mutex
var m = make(map[string]int)

func lookup(key string) int {
    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock()
    return m[key]
}
```

You can see this style is more simpler and easier to comprehend.

The `defer` statements are executed in Last-In-First-Out sequence, which means the functions in latter `defer` statements run before their previous buddies. Check the following example:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    defer fmt.Println("First")
    defer fmt.Println("Last")
}
```

The running result is here:

```text
Last
First
```

Although the function in `defer` statement runs very late, the parameters of the function are evaluated when the `defer` statement is executed.

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func main()  {
    i := 10
    defer fmt.Println(i)
    i = 100
}
```

The running result is here:

```text
10
```

Besides, if the deferred function is a function literal, it can also modify the return value:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func modify() (result int) {
    defer func(){result = 1000}()
    return 100
}

func main()  {
    fmt.Println(modify())
}  
```

The value printed is `1000`, not `100`.
