# Short variable declaration

Short variable declaration is a very convenient manner of "declaring variable" in `Go`:

```text
i := 10
```

It is shorthand of following \(Please notice there is no type\):

```text
var i = 10
```

The `Go` compiler will infer the type according to the value of variable. It is a very handy feature, but on the other side of coin, it also brings some pitfalls which you should pay attention to:

\(1\) This format can only be used in functions:

```text
package main

i := 10

func main() {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
```

The compiler will complain the following words:

```text
syntax error: non-declaration statement outside function body
```

\(2\) You must declare **at least 1 new variable**:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var i = 1

    i, err := 2, true

    fmt.Println(i, err)
}
```

In `i, err := 2, false` statement, only `err` is a new declared variable, `var` is actually declared in `var i = 1`.

\(3\) The short variable declaration can shadow the global variable declaration, and it may not be what you want, and gives you a big surprise:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

var i = 1

func main() {

    i, err := 2, true

    fmt.Println(i, err)
}
```

`i, err := 2, true` actually declares a **new local i** which makes the **global i** inaccessible in `main` function. To use the global variable but not introducing a new local one, one solution maybe like this:

```text
package main

import "fmt"

var i int

func main() {

    var err bool

    i, err = 2, true

    fmt.Println(i, err)
}
```
